## About The Project

We built a large portion of the core Facebook user functionality in this project. There is no Javascript-heavy front end stuff but you wonâ€™t need it to get a nice user experience.

It includes some basic integration tests that checks if the page is loading properly and unit tests to make sure the associations have been properly set up.
